Problem 2: Two’s complement

Why use two’s complement to represent negative numbers?

•	When doing addition/subtraction on binary numbers in signed representations we need to apply different logics (circuits) to perform addition and subtraction. (as MSB represent sign)
•	In 2s-complement representation, we represent a positive number as it is and negative number by its corresponding 2s-complement, so we can use the same circuit to perform addition and subtraction. So, this will reduce the number of gates and, consequently, the size, power, and cost of the whole system.
