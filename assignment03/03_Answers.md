## 3. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries. Please read about Morse Code and share the following findings:
### a. What is Morse Code?
Morse Code is a method for transmitting information through a series of on/off lights, clicks, or pulses that can be understood by converting the received dots and dashes into letters of the alphabet. The telegraph used this method to send messages long distances; it used electrical signals to represent the dots and dashes.
### b. Who developed Morse Code?
 The first telegraph invented by Samuel Morse, Leonard Gale, and Alfred Vail generated signals by opening and closing circuits then transmitting the signals to receivers using wires.
